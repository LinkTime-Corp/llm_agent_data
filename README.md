# llm_agent_data

Where the LLM Agents output their data.

We write some LLM agents to collect data and answer some questios we have. This repository is where the agents write their data and we want to share them with anyone who is interested.

## List of all LLM Gen-AI Startups

We want to to create a list of all LLM Gen-AI startups and wha they are working on.

How do we create the list?

- Query Google for "LLM Gen-AI startups"
- Crawl and Scrap all the search results
- Let LLM extract companies from the search results that are identified as LLM Gen-AI startups
- Write the results to a database
- For each company, query its web site to get more information about the company and what they are working on
- For each company, search its name in Google to gather more information about the company
- Generate the list of all LLM Gen-AI startups

We will share the results first and see if we can make the result useful.
